A self-hosted tool to monitor the performance of your Ruby on Rails application.

This is a **simple and free alternative** to the New Relic APM, Datadog or other similar services.

![Demo](docs/rails_performance.gif)

It allows you to track:

- real-time monitoring on the Recent tab
- monitor slow requests
- throughput report (see amount of RPM (requests per minute))
- an average response time
- the slowest controllers & actions
- total duration of time spent per request, views rendering, DB
- SQL queries, rendering logs in "Recent Requests" section
- simple 500-crashes reports
- Sidekiq jobs
- Delayed Job jobs
- Grape API inside Rails app
- Rake tasks performance
- Custom events wrapped with `RailsPerformance.measure do .. end` block
- works with Rails 4.2+ (and probably 4.1, 4.0 too) and Ruby 2.2+

All data are stored in `local` Redis and not sent to any 3rd party servers.

## Production

Gem is production-ready. At least on my 2 applications with ~800 unique users per day it works perfectly.

Just don't forget to protect performance dashboard with http basic auth or check of current_user.

## Usage

```
1. Add gem to the Gemfile (in appropriate group if needed)
2. Start rails server
3. Make a few requests to your app
4. open localhost:3000/rails/performance
5. Tune the configuration and deploy to production
```

Default configuration is listed below. But you can override it.

Create `config/initializers/rails_performance.rb` in your app:

```ruby
RailsPerformance.setup do |config|
  config.redis    = Redis::Namespace.new("#{Rails.env}-rails-performance", redis: Redis.new(url: ENV["REDIS_URL"].presence || "redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0"))
  config.duration = 4.hours

  config.debug    = false # currently not used>
  config.enabled  = true

  # configure Recent tab (time window and limit of requests)
  # config.recent_requests_time_window = 60.minutes
  # config.recent_requests_limit = nil # or 1000

  # configure Slow Requests tab (time window, limit of requests and threshold)
  # config.slow_requests_time_window = 4.hours # time window for slow requests
  # config.slow_requests_limit = 500 # number of max rows
  # config.slow_requests_threshold = 500 # number of ms

  # default path where to mount gem,
  # alternatively you can mount the RailsPerformance::Engine in your routes.rb
  config.mount_at = '/rails/performance'

  # protect your Performance Dashboard with HTTP BASIC password
  config.http_basic_authentication_enabled   = false
  config.http_basic_authentication_user_name = 'rails_performance'
  config.http_basic_authentication_password  = 'password12'

  # if you need an additional rules to check user permissions
  config.verify_access_proc = proc { |controller| true }
  # for example when you have `current_user`
  # config.verify_access_proc = proc { |controller| controller.current_user && controller.current_user.admin? }

  # You can ignore endpoints with Rails standard notation controller#action
  # config.ignored_endpoints = ['HomeController#contact']

  # You can ignore request paths by specifying the beginning of the path.
  # For example, all routes starting with '/admin' can be ignored:
  config.ignored_paths = ['/rails/performance', '/admin']

  # store custom data for the request
  # config.custom_data_proc = proc do |env|
  #   request = Rack::Request.new(env)
  #   {
  #     email: request.env['warden'].user&.email, # if you are using Devise for example
  #     user_agent: request.env['HTTP_USER_AGENT']
  #   }
  # end

  # config home button link
  config.home_link = '/'

  # To skip some Rake tasks from monitoring
  config.skipable_rake_tasks = ['webpacker:compile']

  # To monitor rake tasks performance, you need to include rake tasks
  # config.include_rake_tasks = false

  # To monitor custom events with `RailsPerformance.measure` block
  # config.include_custom_events = true
end if defined?(RailsPerformance)
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails_performance'

# or

group :development, :production do
  gem 'rails_performance'
end
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Create default configuration file:

```bash
$ rails generate rails_performance:install
```

Have a look at `config/initializers/rails_performance.rb` and adjust the configuration to your needs.

You must also have installed Redis server, because this gem is storing data into it.

After installation and configuration, start your Rails application, make a few requests, and open `https://localhost:3000/rails/performance` URL.

### Alternative: Mounting the engine yourself

If you, for whatever reason (company policy, devise, ...) need to mount RailsPerformance yourself, feel free to do so by using the following snippet as inspiration.
You can skip the `mount_at` and `http_basic_authentication_*` configurations then, if you like.

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  ...
  # example for usage with Devise
  authenticate :user, -> (user) { user.admin? } do
    mount RailsPerformance::Engine, at: 'rails/performance'
  end
end
```

### Custom data

You need to configure `config.custom_data_proc`. And you can capture current_user, HTTP User Agent, etc. This proc is executed inside middleware, and you have access to Rack "env".

![Custom Data](docs/custom_data.png)


### Custom events

```ruby
RailsPerformance.measure("some label", "some namespace") do
   # your code
end
```

## How it works

![Schema](docs/rails_performance.png)

In addition it's wrapping gems internal methods and collecting performance information. See `./lib/rails_performance/gems/*` for more information.

## Limitations

- it doesn't track params of POST/PUT requests
- it doesn't track Redis/ElasticSearch or other apps
- it can't compare historical data
- depending on your load you may need to reduce time of for how long you store data, because all calculations are done in memory and it could take some time for high-load apps

## Redis

Gem is using Redis. This is the only one dependency.

All information is stored into Redis. The default expiration time is set to `config.duration` from the configuration.

## Development & Testing

Just clone the repo, setup dummy app (`rails db:migrate`).

After this:

- rails s
- rake test

Like a regular web development.

Please note that to simplify integration with other apps all CSS/JS are bundled inside, and delivered in body of the request. This is to avoid integration with assets pipeline or webpacker.

For UI changes you need to use Bulma CSS (https://bulma.io/documentation).

## Why

The idea of this gem grew from curiosity how many RPM my app receiving per day. Later it evolved to something more powerful.

## TODO

- documentation in Readme?
- capture stacktrace of 500 errors and show in side panel
- time/zone config?
- connected charts on dashboard, when zoom, when hover?
- ability to zoom to see requests withing specific datetime range
- better hints?
- export to csv
- better stats tooltip, do not show if nothing to show
- dark mode toggle? save to the cookies?
- integration with elastic search? or other?
- monitor active job?
- better logo?
- number of requests last 24 hours, hour, etc.
- collect deprecation.rails
- fix misspellings?
- show "loading banner" until jquery is loaded?
- better UI on smaller screens? Recent requests when URL's are long? Truncate with CSS?
- rules for highlighting durations? how many ms to show warning, alert
- elastic search
- searchkiq
- sinatra?
- tests to check what is actually stored in redis db after request

## Contributing

You are welcome to contribute. I've a big list of TODO.

If "schema" how records are stored i Redis is changed, and this is a breaking change, update: `RailsPerformance::SCHEMA` to a newer value.
